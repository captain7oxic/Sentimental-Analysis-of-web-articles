# Sentimental-Analysis-of-web-articles

This repo is a project I did a while back where i had to mine the text , and do all sorts of textual analysis of them, Which involved  - Polarity scores , FOG index, Complexity of words calculation 
Word count , Average sentence length and other things.

I have used BeutifulSoup for mining the articles, and I have used pandas for data manipulation , i have also used NLTK for sentimental analysis of the text, and lastly i tried to make
a power BI dashboard to explain all my findings.

Hope that helps as a summary of the repo you can check out all the code.

Please do no take offenses on this upload , I do not mean to put it out here because of the input url data frame. But it's equally important for me to showcase it. 

Thank you
